                Our story began in 2008 when Judy agreed to help a friend manage their vacation rental. 
                What started as a simple favor quickly grew into something special as word spread about 
                our exceptional service and personal attention to detail.
              </p>
              <p>
                From that single property, we've grown into a trusted family operation serving the 
                beautiful Ute Pass and Colorado Springs area. Our team includes family members who each 
                bring their unique strengths - from maintenance and financial management to guest relations 
                and daily operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we continue the tradition Judy started: treating every property owner like family 
                and every guest like a valued friend. We handle everything from guest communication to 
                property maintenance, ensuring your investment thrives while you enjoy peace of mind.
